Of course...</p> \n    <p>You obviously need HTML and SNDL knowledge if you wanna make this look as nice as possible.</p> \n    <p>But of course since this is just a python variable inserted into HTML code that means that yes, you can:</p> \n    <div class='SNDL-DashList'> \n        <p>Create certain parts of your long description to have parts of your module/plugin info update itself when you rebuild your Store page! For example this is version [ADDON_VERSION] of FlashCFG that built this page!</p> \n        <p>And you can probably do a lot more but since I ran out of ideas, well you go figure it out yourself.</p> \n    </div>",
